## Code Explanation

The code is organized into functions that handle adding elements, spinning the roulette, and GUI setup. It uses Tkinter for creating the graphical interface, allowing user interaction with buttons, entry fields, and labels.

### Description of the Code:
1. Importing Libraries:
  - tkinter: Imported as tk for creating the graphical user interface (GUI).
  - webbrowser: Imported to enable opening links in the default web browser.
  - random: Imported for generating random numbers.
  - time: Imported to introduce delays in the spinning animation.
2. Functions:
  - add_name() Function: Adds the text entered into the entry field to the listbox as a new item when the "Add" button is clicked.
  - spin_roulette() Function: Simulates spinning the roulette by randomly selecting an item from the list of added elements for a specified number of spins when the "Spin" button is clicked. Displays the spinning effect by rapidly updating the displayed text. Finally, shows the randomly selected item as the result.
3. GUI Setup:
  - Root Window Configuration: Sets the window title, background color, and minimum window size.
  - Error Handling for Icon (Optional): Attempts to load an icon for the window; prints an error message if the icon is not found.
  - Frame and Labels: Creates a frame to organize elements within the window. Generates labels for the title, input instructions, added elements, and result display.
  - Entry Field and Buttons: Provides an entry field for user input. Includes functional buttons ("Add" and "Spin") for user interaction.
  - Listbox Display: Displays added elements in a listbox with a dark-themed background and white text.
  - Clickable Link Label: Sets up a label displaying a clickable link to the GitHub repository for the pyroulette project. Configures the label to open the GitHub repository when clicked.
4. Callback Function for Clickable Link:
  - Defines a callback function to handle opening the GitHub link when the label is clicked.
5. Root Window Loop:
  - Enters the main event loop to start the GUI application, waiting for user interactions.
